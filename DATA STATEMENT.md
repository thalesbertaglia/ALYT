## A. CURATION RATIONALE 

The corpus is composed by YouTube comments mostly in English extracted from videos about three topics -- Veganism, Gender Identity, and Workplace Diversity.
We selected the videos manually based on the number of comments and the channel popularity. We split the videos into three categories: Personal, Official, and Reaction videos. 

We initially retrieved all comments from the videos (excluding replies), then filtered comments which had less than three words or contained URLs. 
Finally, we randomly sampled 20k comments to be annotated.

- The publication date of the videos ranged from 2016 to 2019.
- We collected the comments between April and May of 2020.

## About data statement document

A [data statement](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q18-1041/) is a characterization of a dataset that provides context to allow developers and users to better understand how experimental results might generalize, how software might be appropriately deployed, and what biases might be reflected in systems built on the software.

Data Statements are from the University of Washington. Contact: [datastatements@uw.edu](mailto:datastatements@uw.edu). The markdown Data Statement we used is from June 4th 2020. The Data Statement template is based on worksheets distributed at the [2020 LREC workshop on Data Statements](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/data-statements-for-nlp/), by Emily M. Bender, Batya Friedman, and Angelina McMillan-Major. Adapted to community Markdown template by Leon Dercyznski.
